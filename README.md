# Temporary-File-Cleaner
 This tool is used to delete temporary files.
This tool is used to delete temporary files. You can set a timer after which it will automatically delete the temporary files. You can also force the deletion of temporary files, but it will take a bit longer to complete the operation. Some files cannot be completely deleted, such as those used in real-time (for example, by browser extensions). The deleted temporary files can be both user files and Windows files (the Automatic Cleaning will delete both).
